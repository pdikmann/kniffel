buttons:
- connect to server

data:
onlineMode = {
  connected: <bool>,
  localPlayer: <int>,
  sessionName: <string>
}

additional checks:
on every ui interaction:
  if (state.currentPlayer != onlineMode.localPlayer) { return }
  [...]
  if (state.currentPlayer == onlineMode.localPlayer) { post state }

connect to server: async request to server
server returns state as file
state contains player count
if player count > 0 then copy state from server
start requesting every .5 sec until currentplayer == localplayer

php file:
takes get request

host game:
save state under supplied session name,

join game:
get online,
start requesting state under supplied session name

leave game:
stop being online, new game

============================================================================================

- use redux model for state for better visibility
- unify state into single variable for easier handling
